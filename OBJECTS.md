**Objects:**
The real world is characterised by objects and their interactions.A software application which is developed in the present context should be using Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) for producing a closer reepresentayion of the real world. Java is a language that enforces OOP technique to solve such real world issues.


***Introduction to objects:**
Object is an entity with certain characteristics and behaviour. A typical Java program creats a number of objects in order to perform the tasks and interact. Memory is created as soon as an object is declared.
An object consists of : 

1. State: represented by attributes of an object. Also reflects the properties of an object.
2. Behavior: represented by the methods of an object. Also reflects the response of an object with other objects.
3. Identity: gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.

***Declaring objects in Java:**
When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object. A single class may have any number of instances which means number of objects can be declared for a class.

***Syntax to create an object:**
[class name] [object name] = new [class name];
